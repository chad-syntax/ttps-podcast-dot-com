Only you can find out by tuning in again this week to the Talking Tech while Poking Smot podcast featuring your host, chad_$yntax.

How they are important, annoying, somehow complicated and potential vulnerable. We then pivot to retreading some ground from last week about docker, kubernetes and environment variables. Then we quickly move on to a question about \"web dev basics\" which really sounded like \"dev ops basics\" to me. We end on a question about databases which I give somewhat of an answer to.

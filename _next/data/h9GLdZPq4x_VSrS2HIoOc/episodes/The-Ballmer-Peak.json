If you listen you will understand what that means and why I'm having such difficulty writing this description right now. Auto-correct is doing a LOT of work lmao. We talk about the Ballmer peak and what it's like to get absolutely blasted and still write code. In short: It's cool to write code inebriated, I guess. We talk about the cons of using javascript frameworks, and then seamlessly transition, out of order to the next query about side-activities to improve as a software engineer. We find our way back to the age old question of \"It's always been done that way\" and how to answer it. Then we end with a slight rant that is somewhat tbd about the secret to becoming a god programmer or some shit. I sweat I'lll tell you next episode.
